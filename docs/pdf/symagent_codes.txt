The agent SDK implements a client/server communication with the J2EE
servlets via the HTTP protocol over SSL.

Definitive documentation for the response status codes for HTTP-based
resources is specified in RFC 2616, "HTTP/1.1", particularly in
sections 6 and b10:

	http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2616.html

The status codes which the server will use to respond to agent
requests include the following:

  200  SC_OK		"OK"

This indicates normal operation, i.e. the agent keeps going.

  202  SC_ACCEPTED	"agent is not provisioned yet"

The agent's login was received, and appears to be in the appropriate
format, but there is not provisioning/configuration authorized for
this agent yet.  The agent should wait for a while and then try again.
(See RFC 2616, section 10.2.3).

  400  SC_BAD_REQUEST	"agent protocol error"

There was a problem with the request XML format or login data
provided, such that the request cannot be understood within the
context of the agent protocol.  Kill the agent/plugin causing the
problems.  (See RFC 2616, section 10.4.1).

  599  SC_SERVER_ERROR	"database is unavailable"

The database or some other critical system on the server side is not
available.  The agent should wait for a while and then try again.
(See RFC 2616, section 10.5)


There could be other cases where a SC_CONFLICT (409) may be used, for
instance if the server detects something untoward in the values of
app_signature, mac_addr, guid, platform, etc. -- this is TO BE
DETERMINED.
