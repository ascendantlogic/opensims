This is a follow-up to our meeting on the 23rd.\
\
- -----------------------\
\
libsymbiot (the library) depends on the following 3rd party libraries:\
\
* expat: http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/\
\
The source code for expat 1.95.7 (the current release) is currently included\
with the libsymbiot code.  The configuration script for libsymbiot will use\
an already-installed version of expat if it is the current release, or it\
will build the included version if either expat is not available or if it is\
not the current release.  Note that if the included expat is built, then\
expat's code is included directly into libsymbiot -- it is not installed\
onto the system as a library, which is what the expat configuration script\
usually does.\
\
* OpenSSL: http://www.openssl.org/\
\
The library requires that OpenSSL already be installed on the destination\
system.\
\
- -----------------------\
\
symagent-network (the agent that watches network traffic) depends on:\
\
* pcap: http://www.tcpdump.org/\
\
Currently, the agent requires that libpcap already be installed on the\
destination system like OpenSSL, above.  However, I intend to change the\
behavior to match expat (above), in that it will use an already-available\
libpcap if possible or an included version will be built if necessary.\
\
- -----------------------\
\
These are the only dependencies to date.\
