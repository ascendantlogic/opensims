Release Notes: OpenSIMS_0.9 LiveCD fc1

=======================================================================
OpenSIMS 0.9 Release Notes                                 21 May 2006
=======================================================================

First off, this release of OpenSIMS is mostly a renovation of the code base
from the 0.8 series for resiliency. There were a lot of major stability bugs
which were addressed during the last year. I'm not claiming it's perfect,
I'm just happy to see it better off. There is one "out of memory" and/or
"race condition" bug that I'll enter as a priority 0 bug on source forge
that you should be aware of. It's inconsistent, but happens quite often on
systems that are prone to its occurrence.

There are quite a few of the other items that are still in limbo. Most
particularly, user/group access permissions are stubbed out, but
hap-hazardously used throughout. A real treatment of how multiple users and
organizations are handled will be addressed in the next few coming versions.
Also, the flash front-end is starting to show its age. I expect that we will
spend some time on refactoring some of that navigational code into AJAX and
leaving Flash for the few things that it's really good at (mostly
animations).

Some comments about the LiveCD: I mostly build the LiveCD with the intention
of using it to demonstrate how the base OpenSIMS system was designed to be
installed. A great number of people commented on the difficulty that they
had with prior OpenSIMS versions in getting the right versions of Java, gcc,
torque, postgres, etc, etc. The LiveCD should pretty much work out of the
hat. The reasons it might not work are:

 1> The kernel doesn't have some esoteric driver for some weird hardware. 
 2> The hotplug/coldplug kernel module loader flaked out not finding stuff. 
 3> Various problems with the circumstances of how its wired into the net. 
 4> Little blue devils have popped up and are nibbling at fringes.

Also, a nice point about the LiveCD is that I've gotten the system built
with the most bleeding edge stuff. It has the latest kernel (2.6.16) and the
latest versions of all other dependent packages (libsymbiot, symagent,
snort, nmap, JAVA, postgres, torque, et al). For now, if you want to install
OpenSIMS in a more permanent fashion, you'll need to copy it from the ISO
image (CD) and tweak with the configs for your environment. I fully expect
to have a "package installer" built into the next LiveCD release (probably
0.9.1) that will allow you to just boot the CD then point it at a fresh hard
drive.

Speaking on that topic, you might also notice that I've chosen to build the
LiveCD base from the Gentoo distribution. I'm particularly warm to Gentoo,
so if that really chaps your hide, then I apologize in advance. For those
Gentoo nutz, I'll probably have an e-build out shortly so you can just
emerge it. For those of you that favor other distros, whurley has a gang of
guys interested in making ports for FreeBSD, NetBSD, Debian, and RedHat
(although an RPM is going to take some doing).
